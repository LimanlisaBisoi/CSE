#  CSE Vault: Code, Concepts & Chaos
A curated collection of academic and personal projects covering key areas in Computer Science and Engineering. 
A digital playground for all things Computer Scienceâ€”algos, OS hacks, DB drills, compiler magic, and random code experiments. Built while surviving deadlines, coffee highs, and GATE prep. Dive in, explore, break stuff (safely).
